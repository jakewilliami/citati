## Project History

Late March, 2024, while I was writing my Honours thesis, I wrote a small Julia program to look through a LaTeX document and its references file to find unused citations.<sup>[[1]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/02b69b8)</sup>  Then, in mid May, I broadened the scope of this script to check pages,<sup>[[2]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/0700185)</sup> articles,<sup>[[3]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/1993b71)</sup> incollections,<sup>[[4]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/484eb70)</sup> books,<sup>[[5]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/1cd5769)</sup> and DOIs,<sup>[[6]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/b28dbf9)</sup> and to count citation types.<sup>[[7]](https://github.com/jakewilliami/PSYC489-2023-2024/commit/ee473cc)</sup>

Finally, in October, 2024, I have some time to port this functionality to a real command-line tool.
